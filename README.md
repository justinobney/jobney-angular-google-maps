==========================

This is the Angular Google Map service I have come up with. It works well for me. Uses InfoBox.js for 
custom map info windows.

Simple Info:
* AngularJS
* Google Maps API - V3
* Infobox.js for custom info windows
* Uses interpolation to allow for custom per marker templates and data-binding (WIN)
